# Sylvester Standalone

![Sylvester Stallone](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/sgpaction/pages/379/attachments/original/1360117128/tumblr_ltuanqmAHR1r4z04wo1_500.jpg?1360117128)

`sylvester.sh` aims to be a script to generate standalone versions of Ruby gems.
Perhaps you just want to easily transfer a command-line gem between two
machines, or you want an easy way to distribute your script without relying on
RubyGems. Whatever the reason, `sylvester.sh` has you covered.

### Usage

Creating a standalone version of your gem is pretty simple!

~~~console
$ sylvester.sh path_to_my_gem/
~~~

The script will generate an executable file that is ready to use.
